Question:
Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Primes

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.
Passed

sumPrimes(10) should return a number.
Passed

sumPrimes(10) should return 17.
Passed

sumPrimes(977) should return 73156.

Solution:

function sumPrimes(num) {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    if(isPrime(i)) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

function isPrime(n){
  if(n <= 1) {
    return false;
  }
  for(let i = 2; i <= (n/2); i++) {
    if(n % i === 0) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true;
}

sumPrimes(10);
